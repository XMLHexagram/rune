//! Tracks that only a platform's own SDK may play, such as DRM-protected tracks of a streaming
//! service. They stay in the player's queue, and while one is current a host on the platform
//! plays it and reports back. The player keeps the queue, the play order and its modes, and the
//! host holds only what the player gives it: the current track, and the track after it when the
//! same host plays that one too, so that it moves on without a gap.
//!
//! # The host contract
//!
//! Hosts may be written in Swift, Kotlin or JavaScript, and what follows is all that a host has
//! to know. Messages are JSON in camelCase. The names of the actions and of the `jukebox` events
//! come from Subsonic's `jukeboxControl`, and stay as they are on the wire; its `get` and
//! `shuffle` actions are not used.
//!
//! ## Start
//!
//! A host reports [`HostEvent::HostReady`] when it starts and again after every restart, before
//! it applies any batch. A host that starts holds nothing, so a `hostReady` from the host of the
//! current track makes the player hand that track over again. `authorized: false` makes its
//! tracks unavailable as access revoked, and `canPlay: false`, as from a platform with no player
//! for the host, as a library that cannot be reached: the track the host plays fails, and its
//! other tracks fail without being sent to it, until a later `hostReady` says that it can play.
//!
//! ## Batches and the queue
//!
//! The player sends [`HostCommand`]s: batches of [`HostAction`]s under one revision, each higher
//! than the one before, which the host applies in order.
//!
//! The host keeps a queue of track ids, and one entry of it is current. Indexes count from 0 at
//! the latest `set`, and name the same entry until the next `set`: after a `set` the player only
//! appends an entry, or removes the last one before the host gets to it. A host that forgets
//! played entries on its side still takes and reports indexes as they were. A host never removes
//! the entry it plays: it ignores a `remove` aimed at it and keeps reporting, as when the player
//! changed its next track just as the host moved on to it.
//!
//! A hand-over is one batch: `set`, `skip` to index 0 at the place to play from, `setGain`, and
//! `start`, or `stop` to wait there paused. While the track plays, `remove` and `add` change the
//! track after it in place. When the host's tracks stop being current, other than by the host
//! moving on, it gets `stop` and `clear`.
//!
//! ## Reports
//!
//! [`HostEvent::JukeboxStatus`] names the current entry by its index and by its id, and says
//! whether it plays and where it stands. A host reports one once it applied a batch, at least
//! every few seconds while it plays, and at once when it moves on by itself. Once told to play,
//! it has 10 s for its first report; after that, 15 s without a report while it plays counts as
//! a failure of its track.
//!
//! At the end of an entry with an entry after it, the host makes that one current, plays it
//! without a gap, and reports a status with its index, one higher, and its id.
//! [`HostEvent::JukeboxEnded`] means that the last entry finished with nothing after it; a move
//! to the next entry is never reported as an end. A status whose entry is not the one the player
//! put at that index tells the player that the host lost its queue: at the current track's
//! index, the track is handed over again, and fails if that happens twice; one index higher, the
//! current track counts as played through, and the track that comes next is handed over anew.
//!
//! [`HostEvent::JukeboxItemFailed`] says that the entry at `index` cannot be played. The host
//! does not move on to an entry that it cannot play: when the entry before it ends, it reports
//! `jukeboxEnded`. The player takes a failed next entry out of the host's queue and hands it over
//! anew once it is current, and marks it unavailable if it fails then too.
//!
//! ## Revisions
//!
//! Every event carries the revision of the latest batch that the host applied.
//! - A status counts unless a later batch changed which entry is current, where it stands or
//!   whether it plays: `set`, `skip`, `start`, `stop` and `clear` make earlier statuses stale,
//!   while `add`, `remove` and `setGain` do not. A status about an entry the player no longer
//!   keeps at that index is told apart by its id.
//! - `jukeboxEnded` and `jukeboxItemFailed` about an entry count from the batch that gave the host
//!   that entry: the `set`, or the `add` that queued it. The failure of the next entry names its
//!   index, one past the current one.
//! - A host that gets a batch after its queue ended reports `jukeboxEnded` again, with that
//!   batch's revision.
//!
//! ## Next, Previous and seeking
//!
//! Next, while the host holds the track that Next goes to, is a `skip` to that entry at 0 and a
//! `start`. When the host had just moved on to it by itself, the track starts again from 0.
//! Previous, and any other choice of track, is a new hand-over. A seek is a `skip` within the
//! current entry.
//!
//! ## Unknown input
//!
//! Events of unknown types, unknown failure reasons and extra fields are ignored, and a message
//! that does not parse is logged and dropped. `positionMs` may be an integer or a float.
